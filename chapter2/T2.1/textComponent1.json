If you've come this far into the tutorial and played the other games you've already encountered multiple **pageTransitions**. They connect each page with another and will always be rendered at the bottom of a page. If you take a look at `pageTransition1.json` in <a href=\"https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, you'll see that it first of all defines the page it leads the player to -- in this case T2.2. In the `pageTransition1.json` file you link to the `page.json` of the page you want to connect with the current page. Besides that you can also edit the contents of the button, here it's \"To page T2.2, recommended beginner workflow\". These are the essentials to get you started with connecting the pages of your game.<br><br>One central utility of **pageTransitions** is *branching*. Using multiple **pageTransitions** leading to different storylines you can give the player's decisions weight and increase the replay value of your game. It's best to have a clear distinction between these branches in the repository, so dividing your game into chapters and having a clear folder hierarchy are essential.<br><br>Something about visited and other criteria."
