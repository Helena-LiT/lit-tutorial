If you've come this far into the tutorial and played the other games you've already encountered multiple **pageTransitions**. They connect each page with another and will always be rendered at the bottom of a page. If you take a look at `pageTransition1.json` in <a href=\"https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial\" class=\"underlined\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, you'll see that it first of all defines the page it leads you the player to T2.2, the next page. In the `pageTransition1.json` file you'll have to link to the `page.json` of the page you want to link to. Besides that you can also edit the contents of the button. These are the essentials to get you started on connecting the page of your game with each other.<br><br>One essential part of **pageTransitions** is *branching*. Using multiple **pageTransitions** leading to different storylines you can give the players decisions weight and increase the replay value of your game. It's best to have a clear distinction already in the repository, so dividing your game into chapters and having a clear folder hierarchy are essential.<br><br>Something about visited and other criteria."
