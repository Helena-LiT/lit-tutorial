  "markdownContent": "To have two modules appear next to each other, like the picture on the left side and this text, you have to make sure, that the value of *numberOfColumns* and the *offsetColumns* of **both** modules add up to at most 12. Here the image has a width of 3 and an offset of 2 and the text has the width of 4 columns and leaves 1 column to the left empty. This way *Marugoto* renders them next to each other. The image on the left has the *renderOrder* value 2, so it gets rendered first starting from the left side. This text with the *renderOrder* value 3 is on the right side, right next to the image, because it's small enough to fill up the remaining columns left empty."
