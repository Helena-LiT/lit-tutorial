In this and the next few pages, we'll focus on page layout and design. Please don't worry about the Notebook feature, or the Inbox feature, and please *try* to concentrate on what we're saying without being distracted by emails, telephone calls etc., okay?<br><br>So, the first thing to say is that your &#46;json files will be stored in various folders and sub-folders on your computer. This tutorial has several *Chapter* folders, and each *Chapter* folder comprises (i) a `chapter&#46;json` file and (ii) *Page* subfolders.<br><br>In these *Page* subfolders (this one is called T1.1), you will store all the `&#46;json` files that you need in order to give the page in your internet browser its basic functionality. At the very least, these will be:<br>* a `page&#46;json` file: this is the home file for each *Page* folder<br>* a `pageTransition1&#46;json` file: this will enable the player to move from one page to the next on their browser<br>* almost always, a `textComponent1&#46;json` file: that's what you're reading *right now*.<br><br>Incidentally, before we go on: the `textComponent&#46;json` files are written in basic markdown (add hyperlink). We can come back to this."
