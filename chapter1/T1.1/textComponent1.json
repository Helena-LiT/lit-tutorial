Where relevant, throughout the guide, we'll even link from the rendered game content to the source files themselves, such as <a class='underlined' href='https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial/blob/master/chapter1/T1.1/textComponent1&#46;json' target='_blank'>the file that defines this paragraph</a>.\n\nIn this and the next few pages, we'll focus on page layout and design. Please don't worry about the *Notebook* feature, or the *Inbox* features just yet, and please *try* to concentrate on what we're saying without being distracted by emails, telephone calls etc., okay?<br>So, the first thing to say is that your JSON files will be stored in various folders and sub-folders on your computer, always with a <tt>&#46;json</tt> file extension. This tutorial has several <tt>chapter</tt> folders, and each <tt>chapter</tt> folder comprises (i) a <tt>chapter&#46;json</tt> file and (ii) <tt>page</tt> subfolders.<br>In these seqentially named <tt>page</tt> subfolders (this one is called <a class='underlined' href='https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial/tree/master/chapter1/T1.1' target='_blank'>T1.1</a>) you will store all the JSON files that you need in order to give the game some basic features and functions. At the very least, these will be:<br><br>1. <a class='underlined' href='https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial/blob/master/chapter1/T1.1/page&#46;json' target='_blank'>a <tt>page&#46;json</tt></a>: this is the \"home\" file for each <tt>page</tt> folder, containing its title, and some meta-information\n2. <a class='underlined' href='https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial/blob/master/chapter1/T1.1/pageTransition1&#46;json' target='_blank'>a <tt>pageTransition1&#46;json</tt></a>: this will enable the player to move from one page to the next in-game\n3. almost always, <a class='underlined' href='https://github.com/uzh/lit-tutorial/blob/master/chapter1/T1.1/textComponent1&#46;json' target='_blank'>a <tt>textComponent1&#46;json</tt></a>, whose contents you are reading *right now!*.<br><br>Incidentally, before we go on: the <tt>textComponent&#46;json</tt> files are written in <a class='underlined' href='https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/' target='_blank'>basic markdown</a>, a simple formatting language that you'll need to learn to create engaging context. We can come back to this later on."
