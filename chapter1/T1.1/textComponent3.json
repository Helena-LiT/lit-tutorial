  "markdownContent": "These three variables -- *numberOfColumns*, *offsetColumns*, *renderOrder* -- are part of every module you encounter on a page. The image you see above this text relates to `imageComponent1.json`. If you look at the file in the repository, you'll see that there are other variables compared to the **textComponent** file. To use **imageComponent** you have to tell *Marugoto*, which image it should display by defining the path to it. In this case it's the image `T_Coffee.jpg` you can find in the resources folder. Below that, you can then add a caption to the image. If you look at the video and the audio modules below and their relating `videoComponent1.json` and `audioComponent1.json` files in the repository you'll see, that they essentially work the same way. In case of the video, which -- like the audio file -- is part of *Plantation Lives*, there is even a hyperlink in the caption!<br><br>These are the basics of page content in *Marugoto*. By clicking the transition button below you will proceed to the next topic: **textExercise** and **dateExercise**."
