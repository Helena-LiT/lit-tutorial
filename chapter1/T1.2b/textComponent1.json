  "markdownContent": "The other key-task in *Marugoto*, the **dateExercise**, works similar to the **textExercise*. The exercise below is taken directly from *Plantation Lives*. If you take a look at the repository, you'll see the image of the gravestones as **imageComponent** and four **dateExercise** files. In **dateExercise**-files you can additionally define the *label*, this is the smaller text above each box. The player is tasked with transcribing the dates on the gravestones and filling them into the **dateExercise** boxes. Once again, to make sure the player has done this before proceeding, we'll have to define the correct answer for every one of them and determine this as the criterium to go to the next page. The correct answer is defined by *solution* and *correctDate*, similar to the **textExercise**. In **pageTransition1.json* you then have tell *Marugoto* that the player can only proceed, if they have completed -- in this case -- all four of the **dateExercise**. So you have to repeat the process from the previous page and define the *exerciseCriteria* for each exercise as *correctInput* and tell *Marugoto* where to look with *affectedExercise*. *dateExercise* uses DD.MM.YYYY, so keep that in mind when crafting your own tasks."
