  "markdownContent": "One way to have characters in your game communicate with the player is the mailing function. To have a mail delivered to a player on a page, there have to be both a `mail.json` file and a `character.json` file. The first file defines the contents and the way the mail will be delivered. If you take a look at the `mail1.json` in the folder T1.4 you'll see multiple variables you don't know yet. *from* defines the character who send you the mail and contains the path to the `character.json`. The `character.json` contains the first and last name of the sender. In the `mail.json` you can decide the time after loading the page when the mail should be delivered. For the example mail on this page it's 10, so after 10 second upon loading the page a mail should appear in the upper right corner. If you want to the mail appear as soon as the player enters the page, you'd use the time 0. With *openOnReceive* you can define if the mail should work like a pop-up, so as soon as it's delivered the player is interrupted and the inbox opens by itself, or -- like the example mail on this page -- appears in the inbox and the player as to click on the button to read it. The contents of the mail are controlled with *subject* and *body*, which should be self-explanatory.<br><br>The next page will discuss the dialog function of *Marugoto*, which is the other primary way of communication between characters and the player."
