  "markdownContent": "Having a dialog open after a certain time is easy if you understood T1.5 and T1.5D. You essentially have to create a page with the contents of the second page from the previous example and change the *openOnReceive* to true as well as the time in seconds you want the dialog to appear after. Below that you can create a normal page, with multimedia modules and exercises. Like already mentioned, *Marugoto* will automatically add a button which closes the dialog.<br><br>This concludes Chapter 1 of the Tutorial, which was concerned with the content. The second chapter will look at transitions, general structure and general advice on creating your own game. ADD (cut from T1.5): Now in this case as responses you have to possibility to go back to T1.5, which is this page, or proceed to T1.6, where the timed dialog is explained. These two options each need a `dialogResponse.json` and a `pageTransition.json`. The first file defines the contents and which `pageTransition.json` will be used, and the `pageTransition.json` defines to which page the player will transition to. *Marugoto* also has the functionality that there's one automatically created **dialogResponses** which leads back to the page you're on, so essentially closing the dialog. Once you proceed to the next page you'll see that instead of just two responses, like the files in the repository would indicate, there are three. Now click the transition button to T1.5D below to see all of this in action. Fear not, there will be a go back button.similar to a **mail**, you can define the time upon loading the page when the dialog appears.",
