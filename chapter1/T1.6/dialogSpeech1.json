  "markdownContent": "Having a dialog open after a certain time is easy if you understood T1.5 and T1.5D. You essentially have to recreate the second page from the previous example and change the *openOnReceive* to true and the time in seconds you want the dialog to appear after. Underlying that you can create a normal page, with multimedia and exercises. Just keep in mind that as long as you don't include a *go-back-button*, the player won't be able to return to the contents on the page. That's one advantage of having the players trigger the dialog themselves.<br><br>This concludes Chapter 1 of the Tutorial, which was concerned with the content. The second chapter will look at transitions, general structure and general advice on creating your own game.",
