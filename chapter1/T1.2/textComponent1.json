If you open the **T1.2/textComponent1&#46;json** file on your computer with a software such as Atom or Sublime, you'll indeed see the text you're currently reading in the *markdownContent* line. Now please look at the lines marked:<br><br>* *numberOfColumns*<br>* *offsetColumns*, and <br>* *renderOrder*<br><br>You will always have to assign a value to these lines. With this value, you can choose how to design the layout of the webpage that you're seeing in your internet browser. What you first have to imagine is that the webpage is divided into 12 vertical columns (like a table with 12 cells across its top). The first line, *numberOfColumns*, defines the width of each individual element of the page (that is, how many cells of the table it will use). **textComponent1** has a width of 10 columns, so it is taking up almost all the available width the page. By contrast, **textComponent2** (below) has a width of 8, so you can see it's effectively a smaller text cell."
