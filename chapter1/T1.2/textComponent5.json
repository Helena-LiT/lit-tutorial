You may have intended it to be aligned with textComponent4 (above), but you've set the *offsetColumns* value incorrectly to 5. (If you want alignment, it should be 6). Or perhaps, alternatively, you wanted it to align with textComponent2. If so, you should have set the *offsetColumns* value at 2. I guess you get the picture."
