This defines the title of the entry, be it just a picture or the contents of an exercise, and if it's not in the folder, *Marugoto* won't be able to proceed to the next page as it's looking (desperately) for the title of the entry. (Incidentally, this paragraph, which is a separate *textComponent*, has been saved to Notebook; but because *showInNotebookAt* is set to pageExit, it won't appear until you exit this page.)"
