  "markdownContent": "You've probably noticed that in the files for most of the modules there are two variables called *showInNotebook* and *showInNotebookAt*. The first variable is a Boolean, so it's either true of false. If you look at the **imageComponent.json** in the folder T1.3, the page we're on right now, you'll see that the value for the variable is true. In comparison, the **textComponent** you're reading right now has a *showInNotebook* value of false, so it won't appear in the notebook. *showInNotebookAt* defines when the module will be shown in the notebook. For the **imageComponent** on this page the value is *pageEnter*. This means as soon as the player enters this page, the image will be available in the notebook. Another option is *pageExit*, which is often used for storing **textExercise** after completion. If you want to add something to the notebook there **must** be a **notebookEntry** file in the page folder. It defines the title of the entry, be it just a picture or the contents of an exercise, and if it's not in the folder *Marugoto* won't be able to proceed to the next page as it's looking (desperately) for the title of the entry.<br><br>The notebook functionality is especially useful if you have a longer storyline like *Plantation Lives*. It allows you, the game-creator, to build connections between earlier and later parts of your game. The next page will talk about mailing."
