If you click to the proceed button below you'll get to the explanation for the timed dialog. Like already mentioned, the issue with timed dialog is that players play the game at different speeds and read at various speeds. Because of this it's difficult to properly time the appearence of the dialog if you want to make sure that the player has read everything. So use this functionality with caution. Once you click on the button *Go to T1.6* you'll be lead to a page with only a picture on it where the dialog will appear 5 secounds after you've loaded the page. The dialog on T1.6 will explain how to create such a page.",
