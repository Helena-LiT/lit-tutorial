What a marvellous idea! It sounds like *so* much fun...”<br><br>And so: as a game-creator, this is one way to have a character interrupt the player's progress. Now we come to the question of how to exit the dialog box. Below you see two buttons. The number of such buttons (you must have a minimum of one) corresponds to the number of `dialogResponse.json` files in this page folder. In these files, the variables *to* and *from* should be filled in with the file directory which points to the `dialogSpeech.json`. (In this case, the end of that directory looks like `...T1.5D/dialogSpeech1.json`.) The *buttonText* variable contains the text the player actually sees. And the *pageTransition* variable requires you to fill in the directory which points to the `pageTransition.json` in this page folder. If you have more than one button below---as we do---then you'll need a corresponding number of `pageTransition.json` files. For example, the *pageTransition* variable in `dialogResponse1.json` points *Marugoto* to `pageTransition1.json`; then, the *to* variable in `pageTransition1.json` points to `...T1.6/page.json`.<br><br>Which means that when you click on “Continue to T1.6”, this dialog box will close and *Marugoto* will send you to the next page",
